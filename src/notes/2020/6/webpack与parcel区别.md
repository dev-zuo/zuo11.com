# webpack与parcel区别

webpack与parcel都是打包工具，webpack功能强大，但比较重，配置项比较多，有点繁琐。而parcel就是为了解决配置项太多这个问题的，它默认集成了通用的常规功能，**零配置**，如果自定义较多，还是推荐webpack

> If you don't want to worry about configuring everything and your needs are common needs, you should go directly with parcel. Parcel provides defaults (for babel-preset-env, post-css, html, etc) that fits most scenarios and works for everybody. You don't have to worry about configuring anything.

> From the other hand, if you need a more customization, you should go with webpack. Keep in mind that you will have to setup everything that you need, explicitly set those things.
